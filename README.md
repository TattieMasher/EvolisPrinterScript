# PrinterScript

This short script is intended for use with the FGB RISEx application. This application frequently crashes, causing my colleagues who use our card printers a lot of trouble. Many of these users are not able to sufficiently troubleshoot and resolve these issues and restarting the processes correctly almost always resolves them. This batch script will allow them to perform an initial fix before coming for further help, if required.

The script kills the required processes and restarts them, in the order required to avoid further issues. This should only be ran in the event of the programs crashing.
